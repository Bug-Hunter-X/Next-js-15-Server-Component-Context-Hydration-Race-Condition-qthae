# Next.js 15 Server Component Context Hydration Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 involving server components, asynchronous operations, and React contexts. The problem arises from a race condition where a context's value might not be fully hydrated before being accessed in a server component, potentially leading to `undefined` values or errors. 

## Bug Description

A server component uses `useContext` to access data from a React context.  The context's value is populated asynchronously via `useEffect` and a `fetch` call.  If the server component tries to access the context's value before it's available (due to the asynchronous nature of the data fetching), it will encounter errors.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`. 
4. Observe the error in your browser's console.  The server-side rendering will fail unless the hydration is handled correctly. 

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the context's value is properly available before it is accessed within the server component.  This typically involves using conditional rendering or a loading state mechanism to prevent premature context access.
